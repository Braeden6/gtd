## Phase Analysis and Recommendations

### Current Phase Structure Challenges
1. **Phase 1 (MVP)**
   - Currently well-scoped but could be split into smaller releases
   - Suggest breaking into "Core Capture" and "Basic Organization" phases

2. **Phase 2**
   - Good intermediate features but heavy on system complexity
   - Consider moving some calendar features to later phases

3. **Phase 3**
   - Very feature-heavy phase
   - Recommend splitting into multiple releases
   - Collaboration features might warrant their own phase

4. **Phase 4**
   - Contains critical features that might be needed earlier
   - Some analytics could be moved earlier for user retention
